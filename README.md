# python-classifier-examples
This project would contain the classifier examples in Python. Each example is stored in the respective folder.

Iris:
This example uses Iris data set available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris.
The example verifies 6 algorithms and finally validates with one algorithm. Source and credit for this example: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/

Car:
This example uses Car Evaluation data set available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation.
Though the example is similar to Iris data set, the OrdinalEncoder is used to encode string attributes to numbers.
